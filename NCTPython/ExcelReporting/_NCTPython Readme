This folder 'NCTPython\Excel Reporting'

-----A full working directory to display the many ways to use python
to work with Excel.


We have created certain files that are straight python
We then started using JupyterLab which uses python notebooks.
We can create those notebooks with their local python sections,
or we can call original python files as well, as seen in "_RunAllPyFiles.ipynb"


The starting data is coming from 'supermarket_sales.xlsx'

This directory is then working in order from 1-6

1.py calls that original spreadsheet

Any result spreadsheets that 1...py creates is then labeled with 1...xlsx

The same applies to all #...py and #....xlsx

There are several of the #....py that call other #....xlsx
